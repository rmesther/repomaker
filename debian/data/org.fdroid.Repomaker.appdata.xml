  <summary>Create F-Droid repos with ease</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
      Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
      easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      F-Droid.org is just a repo out of hundreds of repos created by
      individuals all around the globe. With the tools of F-Droid,
      everyone can create their own repo. So whether you are a musician
      who wants to publish their music or a developer who wants to serve
      nightly builds of their app, you are free to create your own repo
      and share it with other people independently of F-Droid.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, creating a repo has been difficult because you had to
      have knowledge on the command line, needed to edit text files to
      edit your packagesâ€™ store details and had to paste screenshots in a
      special system of directories to have them served well inside the
      F-Droid app.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all got easier now: with Repomaker, you are able to create your
      own repo and do not need to have any special knowledge to do so.
    </p>
